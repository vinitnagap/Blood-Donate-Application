Blood Donate Application

This project is developed by three perspective i.e. hospital, blood bank and patient/donor. We have provided security for authenticated user as new user have to register according to their type of perspective and existing user have to login. This project requires internet connection. This application we are developing helps to select the nearby hospital online instantly by tracing its location using GPS. This application reduces the time to a greater extent that is searching for the required blood through blood banks and hospitals. Thus this application provides the required information in less time and also helps in quicker decision making.
